Once upon a time, there was a dude called Bwert who wanted to go to space. He went to a
training academy for astronauts along with thousands or other poeple who wanted to become
astronauts. One the first day of training, Bwert was very nervous. There were so many 
other talented and qualified candidates surrounding him. He was going to have to work 
very hard if he wanted to even have a chance at his dream.

The training academy started the candidates off with no easy task. The first day was
absolutely grueling. The candidates were awoken by bright lights and loud bells at
05:30 sharp. Afterwards, they were given a meager breakfast and forced to go on a 5 mile
run without a hint of what they were going to do next.
