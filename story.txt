Once upon a time, there was a dude called Bwert who wanted to go to space. He went to a
training academy for astronauts along with thousands or other poeple who wanted to become
astronauts. One the first day of training, Bwert was very nervous. There were so many 
other talented and qualified candidates surrounding him. He was going to have to work 
very hard if he wanted to even have a chance at his dream.

The training academy started the candidates off with no easy task. The first day was
absolutely grueling. The candidates were awoken by bright lights and loud bells at
05:30 sharp. Afterwards, they were given a meager breakfast and forced to go on a 5 mile
run without a hint of what they were going to do next.

The training was vigorous and hard. He called his wife saying that he loves her and misses her a lot. She was his lifetime. 

After running, they walked into the round hall, and in front of them was the "centrifuge". Bwert sat in a cylinder with a 7-meter-long iron arm. At a speed of 100 kilometers per hour, his facial muscles began to deform and droop, his blood was pressed to his lower limbs, his brain was ischemic and dizzy, his heart beat was faster, and he had difficulty breathing.

After this, Bwert realized that being astronaut was not his calling so he quit the academy. He went on to discover that his real passion was art, so he went on to become a famous artist. 
The end.
