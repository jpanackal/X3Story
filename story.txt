Once upon a time, there was a dude called Bwert who wanted to go to space. He went to a
training academy for astronauts along with thousands or other poeple who wanted to become
astronauts. One the first day of training, Bwert was very nervous. There were so many 
other talented and qualified candidates surrounding him. He was going to have to work 
very hard if he wanted to even have a chance at his dream.
